Project Take Aways:

    1) Defines the source code structure
    2) Simple assembly variables and arithmetic operations
    3) Introduction to assembler and linker
    4) Intro to ddd for visual and interactive debugging
    5) Intro to gdb for automated testing and debugging

Notes for asm64 script:

    To execute the assemble/link bash script, 
    add execute privilege for the script.

    (While in same directory)

        chmod +x asm64

    Call script with to produce executable named example
